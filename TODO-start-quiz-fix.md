# Fix Start Quiz Button Issue - COMPLETED

## Problem
The "Start Quiz" button in QuizSessionPage.jsx does nothing when clicked. The issue is that the quizAPI.js file is missing Authorization headers for quiz session related API calls, causing authentication failures. Additionally, the startQuiz function in QuizContext.js was not returning the session data or throwing errors properly.

## Root Cause
- `startQuizSession` and other quiz session API methods in `quizAPI.js` do not include the Authorization header
- Server routes require authentication via `auth` middleware
- API calls fail silently or with errors that aren't properly handled in the UI
- The startQuiz function in QuizContext.js did not return the session data on success or throw errors on failure, causing the UI to not transition to the quiz taker component

## Solution
1. Added Authorization headers to all quiz session API methods in `quizAPI.js`:
   - `startQuizSession`
   - `submitQuiz`
   - `getSessionDetails`
   - `updateAnswer`
   - `getProgress`

2. Modified the startQuiz function in QuizContext.js to return the session data on success and throw errors on failure.

3. Fixed QuestionRenderer.jsx to properly handle quiz options as objects with `text` property instead of strings.

## Files Edited
- `quizknow-app6/client/src/services/quizAPI.js` - Added Bearer token headers to quiz session endpoints
- `quizknow-app6/client/src/context/QuizContext.js` - Fixed startQuiz to return session data and throw errors
- `quizknow-app6/client/src/components/quiz/QuestionRenderer.jsx` - Fixed rendering of quiz options for multiple-choice and select-all questions
- `quizknow-app6/routes/quiz.js` - Added routes for updating answers and submitting quizzes
- `quizknow-app6/client/src/components/quiz/QuizTaker.jsx` - Added navigation to results page on "View Results" button click
- `quizknow-app6/client/src/App.js` - Updated route for quiz results to /quiz/:quizId/results
- `quizknow-app6/client/src/pages/QuizResultsPage.jsx` - Updated to load results from user submissions

## Testing
The fix has been implemented. Test by clicking "Start Quiz" button - it should now successfully start the quiz session and display the quiz taker component.
