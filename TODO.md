# Fix Student Dashboard Counters

## Problem
- Total Quizzes counter shows 0 because it's counting submissions instead of assigned quizzes
- Need to verify all counters function correctly

## Tasks
- [x] Fix `/users/quiz-stats` endpoint to count assigned quizzes for totalQuizzes
- [x] Add logging to quiz-stats endpoint to debug
- [x] Fix route ordering issue (quiz-stats before :id)
- [ ] Test all dashboard counters: Total Quizzes, Completed, Avg Score, Study Time, Recent Activity, Submitted Quizzes
- [ ] Verify available, pending, and submitted quiz endpoints are working

## Status
Fixed route ordering issue. The quiz-stats endpoint should now work correctly. Need to test the dashboard counters.
