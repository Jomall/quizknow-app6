# Quiz Publish Issue Fix

## Problem
- Quiz creation and publish functionality not implemented in QuizCreator.jsx
- Quizzes not saved/published to backend
- Instructor dashboard shows 0 quizzes
- Students don't receive quizzes

## Tasks
- [x] Add publishQuiz method to quizAPI.js
- [x] Implement handleSaveQuiz in QuizCreator.jsx to save draft quiz
- [x] Implement handlePublishQuiz in QuizCreator.jsx with student selection dialog
- [x] Add StudentSelector component import and state for publish dialog
- [x] Test publish flow and verify dashboard updates
- [x] Verify students receive published quizzes

## Status
Completed - Route ordering fix resolved the issue

## Summary
The main issue was in the backend routes/quizzes.js where the dynamic /:id route was defined before specific routes like /available, /pending, and /submitted. This caused Express to match route parameters like "available" as ObjectIds instead of the specific routes, resulting in 500 errors.

By reordering the routes to place specific routes before the dynamic /:id route, the student dashboard can now correctly fetch assigned quizzes.

The QuizCreator publish functionality was also implemented with student selection dialog.
